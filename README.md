Native AI inference research: can trained ML models be transformed into
minimal, dependency-light C/C++ inference artifacts without losing
predictive fidelity — and when does that actually beat Python-based serving?

**Philosophy:** train anywhere, deploy natively, measure everything. No
claim that C++ is inherently faster — every advantage is a hypothesis to
benchmark, not an assumption.

## Status (2026-09-16)

Phase 0 (landscape research) and Phase 1 (educational prototype) done —
[research/](research/) has the ecosystem survey, academic literature review,
and gap analysis; [research/experiments/](research/experiments/) has seven
completed experiments (tiny MLP → transformer block → size sweep → three
rounds chasing a warm-latency mystery → the pivot).

**Current value proposition** (revised after experiments, see
[gap-analysis.md](research/gap-analysis.md)'s "Revised recommendation"
section): native C++'s advantage is in **cold/single-shot invocation
latency and dependency footprint** (15-155x faster process-to-answer time,
~10-40x smaller memory/disk footprint, consistent across model
architectures) — **not** warm-server throughput, where it did not beat
ONNX Runtime CPU for any transformer-shaped model tested. Target use case:
serverless functions, CLI tools, intermittently-invoked edge devices —
not sustained high-throughput serving.

## Experiments

1. [Tiny MLP](research/experiments/exp1-tiny-mlp/results.md) — equivalence + benchmark harness established
2. [Tiny transformer](research/experiments/exp2-tiny-transformer/results.md) — warm-latency edge nearly vanishes at scale
3. [Size sweep](research/experiments/exp3-size-sweep/results.md) — crossover isn't about FLOPs
4. [Buffer reuse](research/experiments/exp4-buffer-reuse-sweep/results.md) — ruled out as the cause
5. [GEMM dispatch overhead](research/experiments/exp5-gemm-dispatch-overhead/results.md) — isolates the real mechanism
6. [Naive attention](research/experiments/exp6-naive-attention-sweep/results.md) — negative result, reverted
7. [Cold invocation](research/experiments/exp7-cold-invocation/results.md) — the pivot, with a bug found and corrected along the way

## Roadmap

0. Landscape research & gap analysis — done
1. Educational prototype (tiny NN in Python/C/C++) — done
2. Native runtime core (Tensor, Linear, ReLU, Softmax, LayerNorm, GELU) — done ([native/common.hpp](native/common.hpp))
3. Model equivalence (real trained model) — done for synthetic models; real pretrained model next
4. Benchmarking vs. strong baselines — done, revised toward cold-invocation
5. Packaging
6. Developer experience (CLI)
7. Hugging Face integration
8. Transformer support — architecture proven (exp2-7); real pretrained model not yet tried
9. Hardware optimization (SIMD/CUDA) — Apple Accelerate/AMX only so far; no CUDA hardware available
10. Research publication
